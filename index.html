            MS Dhoni, a popular Indian cricketer, was born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar.
        	He is a wicket-keeper and batsman in professional international cricket.
	        MS Dhoni made his ODI debut on December 23, 2004 against Bangladesh in Chittagong.
	        He served India as a captain in all three cricket formats from 2007 to 2017.
	        He is the only captain for India to have won three ICC tournaments.
	        He wears jersey no. 7 whenever he is on the field or behind the stumps.
	        MS Dhoni has now retired from all three formats, but continues to play for an Indian cricket franchise Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League and has won four trophies since 2008.
	        He had also worked as a ticket examiner in Indian Railways before getting selected for the Indian Cricket team.
	        MS Dhoni is famous for his cool performance on the pitch, because of which he has won multiple prestigious awards. He also received the prestigious Padma Bhushan and the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel for his contribution in the field of cricket.
  	        Bollywood has made a biopic about the life of MS Dhoni, starring late Sushant Singh Rajput in the lead role to showcase the hard time MS faced to grow higher.
